# AI Assistant four our Databases (In progress) 🤖💾

Welcome to the Database Experimentation and AI Assistant project repository! Get ready to embark on a journey where databases meet artificial intelligence, creating a playground for exploration and innovation. 🚀🎨

## Overview

The project unfolds in several exciting phases:

1. **Database Setup**: Let's kick things off by creating a local SQL-based database. Think of it as laying down the canvas for our creative endeavors. There is no need to stop our imagination. So, I encourage you to create your own toy data, starting from a simple relational database to a more complex one so that we can challenge our model again and again.
   - For example for my first table, I have created a table with 100 rows and a name titanic. I added some dummy data in it. Don't worry it won't be the a classification model associated to the titanic dataset that you have already came accross. Bon Voyage! 🚢
        - Initially, I am going to use sqlite3 for the creation. I am not going to add any description at the time. As a result, initilly, I am going to retrieve information by asking specifically by colnames.

3. **Data Extraction Script**: We're not just about storing data; we're about understanding it too! With our Python script, we'll extract all the juicy details from the database, turning data into insights. In this stage we are going to export the information contained in the database hopefull in a readable, for us humans, format or at least for our machines.

4. **AI Assistant Integration**: Time to meet our digital buddy – the AI assistant! This clever companion will interact with the database, bringing data to life with natural language commands. Get ready for some serious magic! 🎩✨

Milestones to celebrate:
  - Return the location that the information we are searching can be found. Ideally, schema and table.
  - Return the location of the required information alongside a querry in order for us to use.
  - Return answer to some easy calculations (like count, unique, sum etc), at the begining.
  - Make things messy and start over. By make things messy, I mean create same features in different tables, so in differenct context, and test our model.


So grab a ☕️ and let's get started!

**NOTE: Alpha Version is going to be a simple version. We are not going to functionize all the process. So be patient for Beta version!**
